Features
----------------

We've decided to use three modules in our project:
> - **Server**
> - **Client**
> - **Communication**

All the logic is in server.
It has been stratified. We have three levels:
> - **Lobby**, that creates the game (or more) and manages it (them).
> - **GameHandler**, that manages a single game.
> - **ClientHandler**, dedicated to I/O with Client.


Client has no game logic.
Communication package is the core of our Communication protocol involved in Server/Client interaction.
Hiding game logic to client we ensure a protection layer to the game, making it harder to find exploitable flaws. 
It also makes it possible to have a lightweight client.

We've made large use of MVC pattern in threads communication.

Map
------------

Maps are defined using **XML** language.
You can choose between 8 maps ( the same of the board game) or import a custom one using its filepath.
The admin is the only one who can change the map in a room.
When the game starts the parser imports the selected map.


Lobby
-----------

**Lobby** is the advanced function we implemented in our project.
It can manage more than a game as you can see in the image.
Every **Room** is a game in which the Admin can set the game rules.
The admin is the one who creates the room; if he leaves, another player will take his place.
